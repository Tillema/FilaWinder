# FilaWinder
 Mechanism to spool your filaments way better than the manufacturer.


This firmware is written by Simon Tillema for a mechanism to spool filaments
on empty rolls.
You can use this firmware without any restriction, but note that using it is
at your own risk. I do not take any responsibility for any harm caused by my
code or the self-fabricated mechanism.
